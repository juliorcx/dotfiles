Suckless terminal with scrollback added with tmux.

Simple theme with terminus font. (_You have to install terminus font first_).

### Go to dwm config file to see the changes

#### NOTE
For those who are using **nnn** in **tmux** within st terminal, and have problems with the Delete key, I let you the discussion [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1700).
