# DWM configuration

In this file I just added some lines to enable the **Fn** key to control the brightness or volume and other things like multimedia keys. Also there is the function to enable the screenshot, **But you have to install _gnome-screenshot_**

To enable the scrollback of st terminal you have to install tmux, thus it has all tmux stuff.
